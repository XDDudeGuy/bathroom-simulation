# Bathroom Simulation
A bathroom simulation written in [rust](https://rust-lang.org) for RCSHS SGA.  
To start, install [python](https://python.org) and [rust](https://rustup.rs)  
Then press win+r to open the run menu.  
Type in cmd.exe and press enter
This will bring up a console window where the remaining commands can be placed:  
```batch
pip install notebook

rustup component add rust-src

cargo install evcxr_jupyter
```
And restart your computer  
***
Now once again open the run menu and type cmd.exe   
Inside cmd enter this command:
```batch
jupyter notebook
```
It should then open a web browser window where you can then navigate through your computer's filesystem until you find ***explanation.ipynb***. Open this file and select the rust kernel. This will contain in-depth explanation into each source file.
